# Simple Blood Center Locator

A Qt project I built for my end semester project at NUST. 
This project has allowed me to understand many programming fundamentals, whilst also learning how to work both the frontend and backend side of things.

### Why I built this:
"A few months ago, my father had heart surgery and urgently needed O-negative blood. My family and I struggled to find local blood centers or even know who to call in that moment. That experience stuck with me. For my end-semester project, I decided to build a simple solution to that problem: a Blood Center Locator. It’s a basic Qt-based app that maps out centers and hospitals, but it’s built to help families avoid the confusion we went through.

### What it does:
* **Login/Sign-up:** Simple user entry screens.
* **Map View:** A basic map display with zoom in/out.
* **Search:** A search bar to find hospitals from a small internal list.

🛠 Requirements
* **Qt 6.x** 
* **Modules:** You need to have 'Qt Location' and 'Qt Positioning' installed via the Qt Maintenance Tool.
