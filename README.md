# Simple Blood Center Locator

A Qt project I built for my end semester project at NUST. 
This project has allowed me to understand many programming fundamentals, whilst also learning how to work both the frontend and backend side of things.

### What it does:
* **Login/Sign-up:** Simple user entry screens.
* **Map View:** A basic map display with zoom in/out.
* **Search:** A search bar to find hospitals from a small internal list.

### Why I built this:
A few months prior my father had a heart surgery and he required O negative blood. We weren't aware of blood centres around us and didn't know where to go or where to call. During that difficult time, I thought of this app and decided to pursue it as my end semester project.
