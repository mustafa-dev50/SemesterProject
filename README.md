# Simple Blood Center Locator

A Qt project I built for my end semester project at NUST. 
This project has allowed me to understand many programming fundamentals, whilst also learning how to work both the frontend and backend side of things.

### Why I built this:
"This app was developed as my end-semester project. The idea was born out of a personal 
challenge when my father had heart surgery and required blood. My family found it 
difficult to locate centers and contact information quickly, so I wanted to build 
a tool that centralizes that information in an easy-to-use desktop interface."

### What it does:
* **Login/Sign-up:** Simple user entry screens.
* **Map View:** A basic map display with zoom in/out.
* **Search:** A search bar to find hospitals from a small internal list.

### Requirements
* **Qt 6.x** 
* **Modules:** You need to have 'Qt Location' and 'Qt Positioning' installed via the Qt Maintenance Tool.

### What I want to add in the future:
In the future I would like to:

1. Add a more interactive experience with the map and hospital search tab
2. Keep a realtime blood stock levels for different blood types in different centres.
